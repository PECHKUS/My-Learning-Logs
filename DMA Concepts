The DMA implementation rule is a sequence of prescribed steps required to activate the DMA hardware and ensure a reliable data transfer.
This rule is rooted in the architecture of the DMA Controller (DMAC) and is universal across most microcontrollers (MCU),
including those that use C and HAL.

** The Core DMA Implementation Rule **
The implementation rule dictates that the Central Processing Unit (CPU) is involved only in the setup and notification stages, adhering to the three phases of DMA operation: Configuration, Initiation, and Completion Handling.
Phase 1: Configuration Rule (Setup)
        The primary rule here is to make the transfer deterministic by programming the DMAC's internal state machine with all transfer parameters before enablement.
